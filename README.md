# Hex Clock

The hex clock simply takes the current time values ( hours, minutes & seconds ) and combines the values as a hexa decimal color value which will be used as the background for the clock. As the time changes the colors respective to the hexa decimal value ( combined time value ) will always be changing in the background.

## Whats special about this ?

Each second the background color changes according to the current time. For 24 hours this clock changes 60 * 60 * 24 = 86400 different colors.
